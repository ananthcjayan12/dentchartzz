# Dental Chart Application Test Plan

### 5. Integration Tests
- [x] Test complete patient registration and appointment booking flow
- [x] Test treatment planning and updating flow
- [x] Test appointment scheduling and management flow

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create test fixtures for common test data
2. Implement model tests first
3. Implement form tests
4. Implement view tests
5. Implement API endpoint tests
6. Implement integration tests

## Test Coverage Goals
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Focus on critical business logic paths
- Ensure all edge cases are covered

## Notes
- Tests will be implemented in Django's TestCase framework
- Use setUp and tearDown methods to manage test data
- Use mocking where appropriate to isolate tests
